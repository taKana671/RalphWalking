# WalkingInBulletWorld

A character walking around on uneven terrain in Bullet World

I thought out the way of rotating camera while avoiding walls and other obstacles to follow a character, and of making the character go up and down the stairs by using the invisible slopes and embedded lifts in the steps. I enjoyed procedurally making all of the houses and bridges.
